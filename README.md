## What is PostgreSQL ?
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS). It has been under active development for over 30 years and is known for its reliability, robustness, and advanced features.

It supports both relational (SQL-based) and non-relational (NoSQL-like) features, making it highly flexible for various types of applications.



#### Features of PostgreSQL 
##### 1. Open Source 
Completely free to use, modify, and distribute , maintained by a vibrant global community and contributors. 
##### 2. ACID Compliance 
Ensures Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability for safe and reliable transactions.

##### 3. Standards-Compliant SQL
Strong support for ANSI SQL standards

##### 4 ADvanced Data Types 
  Support a wide range of types: 
   INTEGER, TEXT, BOOLEAN, DATE, TIMESTAMP,  ARRAY, SON / JSONB, UUID and more 

##### 5 Extensibility 
  You can define your own: 
  Functions ,  Date types , OPerators, index types
##### 6  Powerful indexing 
  Support multiple index types 
    B-tree, Hash, GIN, GiST, SP-GiST, BRIN

##### 7  MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
Allows many users to access the database simultaneously without conflicts or locks.
Great for high-performance transactional applications.


##### 8 Full Text Search
Built-in support for searching textual content using full-text search features.

##### 9  Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW)
Allows PostgreSQL to query external databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, CSV files) as if they were regular tables.




### What is a schema in PostgreSQL ? 
Schema is a collection of logical structures of data. In PostgreSQL, schema is a named collection of tables, views, functions, constraints, indexes, sequences etc.
PostgreSQL supports having multiple schemas in a single database there by letting you namespace different features into different schemas.
For example, you can have a database named postgres and have multiple schemas based on your application like ecommerce, auth etc.

Here's the hierarchy:
 PostgreSQL can have multiple databases in each instance,
 Each database can have multiple schemas,
 Each schema can have multiple tables

 

##3.  Explain the Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL ?
A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. A column cannot have NULL values. It is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence.
Example: STUD_NO, as well as STUD_PHONE, are candidate keys for relation STUDENT but STUD_NO can be chosen as the primary key 


 ### Table STUDENT 

| STUD_NO | STUD_NAME | STUD_PHONE  | STUD_STATE | STUD_COUNT | STUD_AGE |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|----------|
| 1       | RAM       | 9865278251  | Haryana    | India      | 20       |
| 2       | RAM       | 9655470231  | Punjab     | India      | 19       |
| 3       | SUJIT     | 7514290359  | Rajasthan  | India      | 18       |
| 4       | SURESH    | 8564103258  | Punjab     | India      | 21       |

 ### Table STUDENT_COURSE

| STUD_NO | COURSE_NO | COURSE_NAME        |
|---------|-----------|--------------------|
| 1       | C1        | DBMS               |
| 2       | C2        | Computer Networks  |
| 1       | C2        | Computer Networks  |

A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table.
Example: STUD_NO in STUDENT_COURSE is a foreign key to STUD_NO in STUDENT relation.


### Difference Between Primary Key and Foreign Key
| ðŸ”‘ Primary Key | ðŸ”— Foreign Key |
|----------------|----------------|
|A primary key is used to ensure data in the specific column is unique. | A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. |
|It uniquely identifies a record in the relational database table | It refers to the field in a table which is the primary key of another table. |
| Only one primary key is allowed per table. | Whereas more than one foreign key is allowed in a table. |
|It is a combination of UNIQUE and Not Null constraints. | It can contain duplicate values and a table in a relational database |
|It does not allow NULL values . | It can also contain NULL values. |
| Its value cannot be deleted from the parent table. | Its value can be deleted from the child table |
| It constraint can be implicitly defined on the temporary tables. | It constraint cannot be defined on the local or global temporary tables. |

### 4. What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?

|  Feature          |  CHAR                                  |  VARCHAR                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Fixed-length character string            | Variable-length character string           |
| **Storage**          | Fixed length, padded with spaces if needed | Variable length, no padding                |
| **Storage Efficiency** | Less efficient for variable-length data | More efficient for variable-length data    |
| **Maximum Length**   | Must be specified                        | Must be specified                          |
| **Usage**            | Suitable for fixed-length data           | Suitable for variable-length data          |
| **Example**          | `CHAR(10)`                               | `VARCHAR(255)`                             |
| **Example Usage**    | Social Security Numbers, Postal Codes    | Names, Email Addresses, Descriptions       |

### 6. What are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses used for?
The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses in SQL are used to control the number of rows returned by a query â€” especially useful for pagination and data browsing in large datasets.
LIMIT
Purpose: Restricts the maximum number of rows returned by the query.
Syntax 
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT 5;
```
 Returns only the first 5 rows from the table.


OFFSET
Purpose: Skips a specified number of rows before starting to return rows.
Syntax: 
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
OFFSET 10;
```
Skips the first 10 rows and returns the rest.



LIMIT with OFFSET (Pagination)
You often use them together for pagination:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```
Skip the first 20 rows
Return the next 10 rows
Give me page 3, assuming 10 rows per page.

#### When to Use 
Displaying search results one page at a time
Reducing load for large queries
Testing or sampling data quickly
